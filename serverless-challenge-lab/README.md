# Cloud Academy - Serverless Challenge

## Lab

**Reference:** https://cloudacademy.com/lab-challenge/serverless-framework-challenge/

In this lab challenge, I proved my knowledge of the **Serverless framework** by creating an **authenticated microservice** with three functions: 
- one for generating tokens and insert them in a DynamoDB table, 
- one for authenticating the requests, 
- and the last one that sends messages to an SQS queue; 

I created the **DynamoDB** table and the **SQS** queue through the **Serverless framework**.
